# CalmBaby Support

Need help with CalmBaby? Weâ€™re here for you.

## 1. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1. How do I unlock the screen?

A. Tap the four screen corners in the sequence you configured during onboarding. If you forget the sequence, force-quit the App and reopen it to reset the lock.

### Q2. The App is muted on my iPhone even at full volume.

A. Enable the **Ring/Silent switch** or set your device to _ringer_ mode. CalmBaby also ships with _Plays in Silent Mode_ enabled, but some older devices require ringer mode for media playback.

### Q3. Does CalmBaby work offline?

A. Yes. All animations and audio loops are bundled in the App so you can use CalmBaby without an internet connection.
